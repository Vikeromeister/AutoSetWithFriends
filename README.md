# AutoSetWithFriends
A little script that plays the card game Set automatically at setwithfriends.com.

# Usage guide
Start a game in setwithfriends.com in a fullscreen browser (tested with Firefox), on a 1920*1080 screen.
Turn on dark mode.
Zoom in 133%, by holding 'ctrl' and hitting '+' three times.

Install the pipenv with "pipenv install".
Run the script in the pipenv with "pipenv run python Set.py".

# Notes
Feel free to use, modify, or do whatever with this. Please don't cheat in public lobbies and ruin the game for others though.
